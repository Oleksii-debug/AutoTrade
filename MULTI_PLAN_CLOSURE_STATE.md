# AutoTrade — Multi-Plan Closure State

This file is the live GitHub coordination authority for the new multi-plan architecture.

## Binding rules

- Read PROJECT_PLAN_INDEX.md and MULTI_PLAN_PARALLELISM_CONTRACT.md before mutation.
- Drive status lines are migration snapshots; this file is the live status authority.
- Plans 1–7 are independent; there is no earliest global Section across them.
- Within an assigned independent plan, skip terminal DONE and take the first ACTIONABLE unfinished Section.
- Real provider/account credentials are not required for Plan-6 component engineering. Plan 6 is ACTIONABLE_OFFLINE; workers use public specs, existing code and fixtures and must not request credentials from the owner.
- Plan 8 waits for terminal M1-required outputs from Plans 1,2,3,4,5,7; Plan 6 is not required.
- Plan 9 uses named per-Section dependency gates. Sections 2–6 are optional provider/PAPER/LIVE activation and do not block provider-free signed/NVDA/M2-PF release. Skip WAITING/PARKED Sections to the first ACTIONABLE Section.
- DONE is terminal under Simplified Section Closure Protocol v3; reopen only for demonstrated regression, invalid evidence, changed acceptance contract or breaking integration.
- The former SEQUENTIAL_CLOSURE_STATE.md is legacy audit evidence and does not choose work.

| 8 | WAITING_SECTION7 |
| 9 | WAITING_CLAIMED_SCOPE; provider rows may be NOT_ACTIVATED/NOT_CLAIMED |
| 10 | WAITING_SECTION9; provider-free M2-PF does not wait for Sections 2–6 |

Migration note: old parked/partial PRs may have stale bases after the control-plane switch. Their existence is preserved as work/evidence, not as a requirement to merge stale topology. When a Section becomes actionable, refresh head/base/current-main, preserve unique changes, and converge once under the new owner plan.

Update this file in the same closure/reopen run whenever a new-plan Section status changes.

## Current provider-input rule — 2026-10-08

Missing real provider/account/credential data is a normal expected state, not a development blocker. Plan 6 closes offline against fixtures. Plan 8 is provider-free. Plan 9 Sections 2–6 stay parked until external activation is actually desired; workers must not ask the owner for provider data merely to keep working.

## Canonical UI rule — 2026-10-08

Plan 5 develops the existing semantic browser-like Web UI as the canonical navigation experience. Desktop embeds that same UI and may add only native host/emergency surfaces. Provider absence must render as NOT_CONFIGURED/UNAVAILABLE while ZERO/SIMULATION/research workflows remain usable.
